title: Non-asymptotic approximations of Gaussian neural networks via second-order
  Poincaré inequalities
abstract: There is a recent and growing literature on large-width asymptotic and non-asymptotic
  properties of deep Gaussian neural networks (NNs), namely NNs with weights initialized
  as Gaussian distributions. For a Gaussian NN of depth $L\geq1$ and width $n\geq1$,
  it is well-known that, as $n\rightarrow+\infty$, the NN’s output converges (in distribution)
  to a Gaussian process. Recently, some quantitative versions of this result, also
  known as quantitative central limit theorems (QCLTs), have been obtained, showing
  that the rate of convergence is $n^{-1}$, in the $2$-Wasserstein distance, and that
  such a rate is optimal. In this paper, we investigate the use of second-order Poincaré
  inequalities as an alternative approach to establish QCLTs for the NN’s output.
  Previous approaches consist of a careful analysis of the NN, by combining non-trivial
  probabilistic tools with ad-hoc techniques that rely on the recursive definition
  of the network, typically by means of an induction argument over the layers, and
  it is unclear if and how they still apply to other NN’s architectures. Instead,
  the use of second-order Poincaré inequalities rely only on the fact that the NN
  is a functional of a Gaussian process, reducing the  problem of establishing QCLTs
  to the algebraic problem of computing the gradient and Hessian of the NN’s output,
  which still applies to other NN’s architectures. We show how our approach is effective
  in establishing QCLTs for the NN’s output, though it leads to suboptimal rates of
  convergence. We argue that such a worsening in the rates is peculiar to second-order
  Poincaré inequalities, and it should be interpreted as the "cost" for having a straightforward,
  and general, procedure for obtaining QCLTs.
