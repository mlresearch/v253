title: Bayesian Optimization for Crop Genetics with Scalable Probabilistic Models
abstract: An overarching goal of crop improvement is to select plants with desirable
  traits so that crops can provide sufficient food and nutrients for humanity in the
  face of climate change. To achieve such a goal, crop breeders utilize genomic prediction,
  in which that genome-wide DNA marker information is used to predict breeding values
  for desirable traits . Genomic prediction is complemented by advancements in high-throughput
  phenotyping, in robots and drones collect orders of magnitude higher amounts of
  trait information than in the past. Although such data are abundant and easy to
  collect, identifying the most biologically meaningful traits for use in genomic
  prediction is expensive. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a strong cost-effective solution
  to identify such meaningful traits. In this work, we quantified the performance
  of BO with a collection of acquisition function and surrogate models for identifying
  good proxies, in a set of +4 million proxies. We found that BO achieves comparable
  sample efficiency to random search while requiring significantly less computation.
  Despite traditional BO and random search techniques performing sufficiently well,
  both search techniques fail to leverage information from related tasks. To this
  end, we propose a pre-trained model as a transfer learning method. Using this benchmark,
  we conduct an extensive empirical study and demonstrate promising results on the
  transfer learning effect, highlighting a core design principle for developing more
  parsimonious optimization algorithms for crop improvement.
