title: In-Context In-Context Learning with Transformer Neural Processes
abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a powerful family of meta-learning models that
  seek to approximate the posterior predictive map of the ground-truth stochastic
  process from which each dataset in a meta-dataset is sampled. There are many cases
  in which practitioners, besides having access to the dataset of interest, may also
  have access to other datasets that share similarities with it. In this case, integrating
  these datasets into the NP can improve predictions. We equip NPs with this functionality
  and describe this paradigm as in-context in-context learning. Standard NP architectures,
  such as the convolutional conditional NP (ConvCNP) or the family of transformer
  neural processes (TNPs), are not capable of in-context in-context learning, as they
  are only able to condition on a single dataset. We address this shortcoming by developing
  the in-context in-context learning pseudo-token TNP (ICICL-TNP). The ICICL-TNP builds
  on the family of PT-TNPs, which utilise pseudo-token-based transformer architectures
  to sidestep the quadratic computational complexity associated with regular transformer
  architectures. Importantly, the ICICL-TNP is capable of conditioning on both sets
  of datapoints and sets of datasets, enabling it to perform in-context in-context
  learning. We demonstrate the importance of in-context in-context learning and the
  effectiveness of the ICICL-TNP in a number of experiments.
