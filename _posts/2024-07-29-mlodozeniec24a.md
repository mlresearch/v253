title: Implicitly Bayesian Prediction Rules in Deep Learning
abstract: The Bayesian approach leads to coherent updates of predictions under new
  data, which makes adhering to Bayesian principles appealing in decision-making contexts.
  Traditionally, integrating Bayesian principles into models like deep neural networks
  involves setting priors on parameters and approximating posteriors. This is done
  despite the fact that, typically, priors on parameters reflect any prior beliefs
  only insofar as they dictate function space behaviour. In this paper, we rethink
  this approach and consider what properties characterise a prediction rule as being
  Bayesian. Algorithms meeting such criteria can be deemed implicitly Bayesian â€” they
  make the same predictions as some Bayesian model, without explicitly manifesting
  priors and posteriors. We argue this might be a more fruitful approach towards integrating
  Bayesian principles into deep learning. In this paper, we propose how to measure
  how close a general prediction rule is to being implicitly Bayesian, and empirically
  evaluate multiple prediction strategies using our approach. We also show theoretically
  that agents relying on non-implicitly Bayesian prediction rules can be easily exploited
  in adversarial betting settings.
