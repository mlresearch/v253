title: 'Fluctuation without dissipation: Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo'
abstract: Stochastic sampling algorithms such as Langevin Monte Carlo are inspired
  by physical systems in a heat bath. Their equilibrium distribution is the canonical
  ensemble given by a prescribed target distribution, so they must balance fluctuation
  and dissipation as dictated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that
  the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not required because only the configuration
  space distribution, and not the full phase space distribution, needs to be canonical.
  We propose a continuous-time Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) as a dissipation-free
  system of stochastic differential equations (SDE). We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck
  equation and show that the stationary distribution is the microcanonical ensemble
  with the desired canonical distribution on configuration space. We prove that MCLMC
  is ergodic for any nonzero amount of stochasticity, and for smooth, convex potentials,
  the expectation values converge exponentially fast. Furthermore, the deterministic
  drift and the stochastic diffusion separately preserve the stationary distribution.
  This uncommon property is attractive for practical implementations as it implies
  that the drift-diffusion discretization schemes are bias-free, so the only source
  of bias is the discretization of the deterministic dynamics. We apply MCLMC to a
  $\phi^4$ model on a 2d lattice, where Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is currently
  the state-of-the-art integrator. MCLMC converges 12 to 32 times faster than HMC
  on an $8\times8$ to $64\times64$ lattice, and we expect even higher improvements
  for larger lattice sizes, such as in large scale lattice quantum chromodynamics.
